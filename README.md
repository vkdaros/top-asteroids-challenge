# Fork from asteroid challenge of TopFreeGames

This project just extends the
[original one](https://github.com/topfreegames/top-asteroids-challenge) by
adding my AI for bots. Check their
[wiki](https://github.com/topfreegames/top-asteroids-challenge/wiki) for more
instructions.

My **vkdrones** are written in C++ and can be found in:

> Bots/cpp/

In order to compile them, it is possible to use the *Makefile* included in *src*
source directory (for Linux). For a cross-platform build, you can use
[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) instead. To do so, just go to *build* folder of
the bot and run:

```
cmake ..
make
```
