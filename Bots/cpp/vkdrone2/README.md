# VKDrone2

This VKDrone version just tries to shoot at the place where the closest enemy is
going to be.
It is based on VKDrone1, but only rotates without moving to other place.

A simplified Makefile (tested only on Linux) can be found in **src** folder. But
you can generate a better one using CMake (recommended). The commands to do that
and compile are:
```
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```
